# Breakaway

  ## Project Description
  **Breakaway** is an app that increases productivity by helping create a culture and community of taking breaks. Track employee PTO and share employee experiences across your company with this fun and seamless user experience.

  ## Application Concept

  **Breakaway from the everyday**

  Taking time off from work is not only an opportunity to recharge, experience something new and connect with family and friends, it also leads to a healthier and happier life.  That allows us to be more productive at work, avoiding burnout and financial consequences for companies.

  According to [research](https://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/media_root/document/Paid%20Time%20Off%20Trends%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf?utm_source=MagnetMail&utm_medium=email&utm_content=8%2E15%2E19%2DPress%2DVacation%20Days%20Release&utm_campaign=pr) from the U.S. Travel Association, Oxford Economics, and Ipsos, Americans threw away a total of 768 million unused vacation days in 2018, which represents $65.5 billion in lost benefits.  This costs companies in the US [$224 Billion per year.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-ATWORKB-2313)

  **Breakaway** helps companies to build a culture of balance in life, encouraging employees to use PTO, creating a more cohesive work environment where employees share their experiences and bond with their coworkers.
